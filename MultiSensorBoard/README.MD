# What?

This was using some sensors. I used a multi-sensort board containing: -

* A BME280 Temp / Pressure / Humidity Sensor (https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/)
* A APDS-9960 Proximity / Gesture / Light sensor (https://www.broadcom.com/products/optical-sensors/integrated-ambient-light-and-proximity-sensors/apds-9960)

The board I used is here: -
